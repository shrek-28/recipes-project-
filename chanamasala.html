    <p>
        Chana Masala, also known as Chole Masala, is an authentic North Indian style curry made with white chickpeas, freshly powdered spices, onions, tomatoes and herbs. Naturally vegan and packed with healthy minerals, protein and fiber, this delicious vegetarian meal can be ready in just 45 minutes minus the soaking time of chickpeas.
        <br>
        Chana is the Hindi word and chole is the Punjabi word for chickpeas. In Hindi, the word masala means a mixture of spices. When the word masala shows up in a dish – like this Chana Masala or Paneer Butter Masala, for example – it specifically refers to a spiced gravy.

                <h4> STEP 1: SOAK AND COOK CHICKPEAS </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Rinse 1 cup dried white chickpeas (a.k.a. chana or chole) in fresh water a couple of times. Then soak them overnight or for 8 to 9 hours in 3 cups of water.
                        <ul>
                            <li> Keep in mind to add enough water to take into account that the chickpeas increase in size during soaking.</li>
                            <li>After they have soaked, later drain all the water and again rinse the soaked chickpeas in fresh water for a couple of times.                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li> 
                        Traditionally dried amla (Indian gooseberries) are added to impart a dark color to the chickpeas. Amla also gives a faint sourness to the stock. If you do not have dried amla, you can opt to add 1 black tea bag. 
                        <ul>
                            <li>If you do not care about the dark color, then you can also just cook the chickpeas with salt and water, or opt to use drained canned chickpeas instead. </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        In a 3 litre stovetop pressure cooker, add the chickpeas along with 2 to 3 dried amla pieces or 1 black tea bag. Add 2.5 to 3 cups of water.
                    </li>
                    <li> Season with ½ teaspoon salt. Stir very well. </li>
                    <li> 
                        Pressure cook the chickpeas for 12 to 15 whistles on medium heat. The chickpeas should be cooked well and softened enough that you can mash them with a spoon.
                        <ul>
                            <li>If you do not have a pressure cooker, then cook the chickpeas in a pot on the stovetop with plenty of water. Depending on the quality and freshness of chickpeas, it can take up to 1 to 2 hours for the stovetop pan method.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    Meanwhile, add all the whole spices for the chole masala to a pan or skillet. Begin to roast them on a low heat. The spices used for masala are the following:
                    <ul>
                        <li> 2 black cardamoms </li>
                        <li> 1 inch cinnamon </li>
                        <li> 3 to 4 peppercorns </li>
                        <li> 2 cloves </li>
                        <li> 1 medium tej patta (Indian bay leaf) or 2 small tej patta </li>
                        <li> ¼ teaspoon carom seeds (ajwain) </li>
                        <li> 1 teaspoon cumin seeds </li>
                        <li> 1 teaspoon coriander seeds </li>
                        <li> 1 teaspoon fennel seeds </li>
                        <li> ½ teaspoon dry pomegranate seeds (if you do not have these seeds, then omit adding them at this step and add dry mango powder or lemon juice later) </li>
                        <li> 1 to 2 dry red chilies (preferably broken and seeds removed) </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li> Stir often and roast the spices until they get extra browned, but not yet burnt. Don’t stop even after they become fragrant, as they need to get more browned than usual. </li>
                <li> Let these roasted spices cool and then grind or powder them finely in a coffee grinder or in a dry grinder. </li>
                <li> By now the chickpeas are cooked (pictured below). You will see a darker brown shade in the white chickpeas. Remove the amla pieces or the tea bag from the stock and discard them. </li>
                </ul>

                <h4> STEP 3: MAKE CHANA MASALA GRAVY </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li> Heat 1.5 to 2 tablespoons of oil in a pan or kadai (wok). Add ½ teaspoon ginger-garlic paste and sauté for some seconds or until their raw aroma goes away. You can use any neutral tasting oil.</li>
                    <li> Then add ⅓ cup finely chopped onions. Sauté stirring often till the onions soften and turn translucent or light brown. </li>
                    <li> Add ½ cup finely chopped tomatoes </li>
                    <li> Sauté the tomatoes stirring often until they soften and the oil starts to leave the sides of the onion-tomato mixture. </li>
                    <li> Reduce the heat. Then add all of the powdered spices that we made, together with ½ teaspoon red chili powder and ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder. 
                        <ul>
                            <li> At this point, you can also add ¼ teaspoon garam masala – which is optional though. </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li> Mix very well. Then add 2 to 3 slit green chilies to the onion-tomato masala mixture. </li>
                    <li> Add the cooked and drained chickpeas. Reserve the stock. </li>
                    <li> Stir and mix very well. </li>
                    <li> Season with salt as per requirement. Mix again. Keep the addition of salt in check as salt is also there in the stock. </li>
                    <li> Add about 1 to 1.25 cups of reserved stock or water. Stir well. </li>
                    <li>
                        For a thinner gravy, cover and simmer on low to medium heat. You can also cook chickpeas without the lid, causing the gravy to thicken and reduce.
                        <ul>
                            <li> Mash some chickpeas with the spoon to thicken the gravy. If you prefer an even thicker gravy, add less water or mash more chickpeas to release the starches. </li>
                            <li> You can keep the consistency you prefer. At home, we prefer chole recipe with a bit of gravy. </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                    <li> 
                        If you have not added dry pomegranate seeds while roasting the spices, then you need to add amchur powder (dry mango powder) now.
                    </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li> About 1 teaspoon amchur powder is enough. However, you can add less or more of it as per your taste. Stir the gravy very well. </li>
                        <li> If you do not have dry mango powder, then add ½ to 1 teaspoon lemon juice or according to your taste.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li> The chana masala is ready to be served.</li>
                    <li> Garnish with chopped onions and cilantro (coriander leaves). Serve the Punjabi chole with fried Indian bread like bhatura or poori, together with a side of sliced onions, ginger julienne and lime or lemon wedges. Yum! </li>
