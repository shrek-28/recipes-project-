    <h2> MALABAR PAROTA </h2>
    <hr size="4" noshade color="black">
    <p>
        Parathas are one of the most popular and loved accompaniments in the Indian flatbread scene. And just like any other curry, lentil or rice-based dish with many variations to it, even the world of parathas has distinct recipes, from region to region. Just like this Parotta Recipe, which can be considered as the South Indian version of the North Indian Lachha Paratha, which simply means a layered paratha. It is a flaky, layered, unleavened flatbread.
        <br>
        The Malabar Parotta can be served with any vegetable curry like veg kadai, veg handi, veg korma or lentil-based curries like dal makhani, paneer ghee roast, etc. Even the simple dal tastes absolutely divine with the Kerala Parotta.

                <h3> MAKE DOUGH </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li> In a mixing bowl or a medium to large tray, take 2 cups (250 grams) all-purpose flour, 2 teaspoons sugar and ½ teaspoon salt or as required. Mix thoroughly with a spoon. </li>
                    <li> Next, add ½ cup + 3 tablespoons lukewarm water. </li>
                    <li> First mix the water with the flour, using a spoon. </li>
                    <li> Then, start bringing together all the ingredients and begin to knead to a soft dough. At first, the dough will be sticky. But as you continue to knead, the water will be absorbed. </li>
                    <li> When water has been absorbed and a soft, supple and smooth dough is formed. Knead for about 12 to 15 minutes. The dough should have elasticity. </li>
                    <li> Cover with a moist cotton napkin or muslin cloth and allow it to rest for 45 minutes to one hour. If short of time, keep it for 30 minutes. </li>
                    <li> Portion the dough into 8 equal sized parts by first making a log of the dough and then cutting it in equal pieces. </li>
                    <li> Roll each portioned dough between your palms and shape into round balls. Place the dough balls in the same bowl keeping some space between each of them.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Pour 3 tablespoons oil all over the dough balls. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li> Lift each dough ball and coat it evenly with the oil. Cover the bowl with a napkin or lid and allow it to rest for 20 to 30 minutes. You can keep for an hour too. </li>
                    <li> Remove oil-coated dough ball from the bowl, and place on a large board or on the kitchen countertop. You can use a large wooden board too, as the rolling surface. </li>
                </ul>

                <ul> 
                    <li> Begin to roll with a rolling pin. It can be tricky initially while rolling, as the dough will slide. But press and roll. </li>
                </ul>
                <h3> MAKE LAYERS - METHOD 1 </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li> Roll to about 12 inches disc or 12 by 9 inches rectangle, having a thin layer. I roll to about some height and then flatten the dough with my fingers. You can even flatten the dough with fingers, instead of rolling it from scratch. </li>
                    <li> Cut 0.5 or 1 cm strips through out the entire dough, vertically. </li>
                    <li> Roll and gently bring these cut strips together. </li>
                    <li> Place the long cut strips of dough collected together on the surface. </li>
                    <li> From one side, roll the dough and bring it together to make a spiral shape. Tuck in and press the end portion of the dough in the center. </li>
                </ul>
                <h3> MAKE LAYERS - METHOD 2 </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li> Roll the flattened dough ball to a thin and almost transparent layer. Roll each ball as thinly as possible with a rolling pin. </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li> You have to roll very thin. If the dough breaks or tears a bit, you can continue to roll. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li> Hold the rolled dough from the top side and gently lift it up. </li>
                    <li> This will bring together the rolled dough into small pleats or folds. </li>
                    <li> Hold one end of the pleated dough, roll it like a spiral and press the last edge on to the center. </li>
                </ul>

                    <li> Prepare the layered dough balls whichever way you prefer. Place them in a bowl covered with lid or moist cotton cloth and keep aside to rest for 15 minutes. </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Cover each layered dough ball as you shape them. </li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <h3> MAKE KERALA PAROTTA </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li> Now, take one of the layered dough balls and place it on your rolling board. Roll to about 7 or 7.5 inches. It will shrink by a few inches.  </li>
                    <li> Place on hot tawa or a flat cast iron skillet. Keep heat to medium high or high. </li>
                    <li> Cook one side for about 30 seconds or till lightly golden and crisp, and then flip. </li>
                    <li> Spread ½ teaspoon oil all over, on this partly cooked side. </li>
                    <li> Cook second side for 30 seconds and flip again. Drizzle and spread ½ teaspoon oil all over. </li>
                    <li> Flip a couple of times and cook until golden and crisp. Press the edges with a spatula, so that they cook well. Remove from pan and keep aside on a plate. 
                        <ul>
                            <li> This way roast and cook in batches the rest of the Parotta. If there is any oil left in the bowl (which was used to coat the dough balls), then use it to roast the last few batches of Parotta. </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li> Once you have placed the Parotta on a plate, wait for half a minute. With your hands in a clapping motion squish the paratha, so that the layers are visible. Making the layers visible is optional. </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li> You can place them in a roti basket and serve while still hot or warm. These are best eaten while still hot as they are soft, tender, slightly chewy and crispy. On cooling, they tend to become more chewy and less softer. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li> Serve Malabar Paratha hot or warm with any curry or lentil-based dish of your choice. </li>
                </ul>
