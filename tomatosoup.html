                    <ul>
                        <li> Cup measurements would be 4 cups chopped tomatoes, ⅓ cup chopped onions and 1 teaspoon chopped garlic. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li> Take 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a medium to large sauce pan or pan. Keep the heat to a low or medium-low. </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Add 1 medium sized tej patta (Indian bay leaf). Fry for 2 to 3 seconds. If you do not have tej patta, then skip adding it. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li> Then add 4 medium-sized chopped garlic cloves. </li>
                    <li> Sauté garlic for some seconds or till their raw aroma goes away. No need to brown the garlic. </li>
                    <li> Add the chopped onions. </li>
                    <li> Stir and mix well. </li>
                    <li> Stirring often sauté onions till translucent. </li>
                    <li> Now add 2 tablespoons whole wheat flour (atta). You can also use all purpose flour (maida). </li>
                    <li> Mix well and begin to sauté the flour on a low heat stirring often. </li>
                    <li> Sauté for about 1 to 2 minutes or till the raw aroma of flour goes away. </li>
                    <li> Then add the chopped tomatoes. </li>
                    <li> Mix them very well. </li>
                    <li> Now add 2 cups water. Instead of water, you can also use veg stock. </li>

                    <li> Then add ½ teaspoon crushed black pepper or add as per taste. </li>

                <ul>
                    <li> Add salt as per taste. </li>
                    <li> Stir and mix well </li>
                    <li> Cover the pan with a lid and simmer the soup mixture on a medium-low heat. </li>
                    <li> In between do check when the mixture is simmering. </li>
                    <li> Simmer till the tomatoes have softened. The tomatoes have to lose their rawness and should soften well. Then switch off the heat and let the soup mixture become warm. </li>
                    <li> Then pour the soup mixture in a blender jar. Remove the tej patta (Indian bay leaf) from the soup mixture before adding the soup mixture to the jar. Do use a good blender. </li>
                    <li> Blend to a smooth consistency. There should be no chunks of onions, tomatoes or cashews. You can also use an electric immersion blender and blend everything directly in the pan itself. </li>
                    <li> Now pour the ground soup mixture in the same pan. </li>
                    <li> Keep the pan on stove top on a low to medium-low heat and gently heat the soup. </li>
                    <li> When the homemade cream of tomato soup becomes hot, switch off the heat and add 2 to 3 basil leaves (chiffonade or chopped). </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li> You can also add any herb of your choice. Instead of basil leaves, you can use cilantro leaves, parsley, oregano, sage, rosemary or any herb you like. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li> Serve cream of tomato soup hot. While serving you can garnish with a few chopped basil leaves or with some sprinkling of crushed black pepper. Serve it with some toasted bread or baguette. </li>
                </ul>
