                <h3> STEP 1: LEAVEN FLOUR MIXTURE </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li> Take ½ teaspoon instant yeast and 1 tablespoon sugar in a bowl.
                    <ul>
                        <li> Swap instant yeast with ¾ teaspoon of dry active yeast or 1.5 teaspoons of fresh yeast. </li>
                        <li> Remember that if you use dry active yeast or fresh yeast, you will have to use lukewarm water to activate them. </li>
                    </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li> Add 1 cup water or as required. </li>
                    <li> Add 1 cup whole wheat flour (atta). </li>
                    <li> Begin to whisk the mixture. </li>
                    <li> Whisk the entire mixture till smooth and without lumps. </li>
                    <li> Cover and allow the mixture to sit for 30 to 45 minutes. During this time the mixture will leaven and you will see many air-pockets in it.</li>
                </ul>
                <h3> STEP 2: MAKING BUTTER NAAN DOUGH </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li> Later add the remaining 2 cups of whole wheat flour, 2 tablespoons softened butter, 3 to 4 tablespoons curd (yogurt) and ¾ teaspoon salt or as required. </li>
                    <li> Mix everything and begin to knead to a smooth, soft dough. </li>
                    <li> Knead to a pliable and soft dough. Cover and allow the dough to leaven for about 25 to 30 minutes. 
                        <ul>
                            <li> For dry active yeast or fresh yeast, keep dough to leaven for 1 hour or until you see some increase in the size of the dough. </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li> Divide the dough in medium sized balls. </li>
                    <li>
                        Cover and keep aside for 15 to 20 minutes.
                        <ul>
                            <li> For dry active yeast or fresh yeast, keep covered for 30 minutes. </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3> STEP 3: ROLL AND COOK BUTTER NAAN </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li> Take a dough ball and lightly dust it with flour. You can also sprinkle some sesame seeds or nigella seeds on the dough ball and then roll it. </li>
                    <li> With a rolling pin, roll into discs with a medium thickness. </li>
                    <li> On a hot tawa or skillet, place the naan bread. You will see air pockets appearing. Keep the heat to medium-high to high. </li>
                    <li> When the base is partly cooked, turn over and let the second side get cooked. </li>
                    <li> When this side is half cooked, remove with the pair of tongs and place the first cooked side touching the direct flame on the stovetop. 
                        <br>
                        The Butter Naan may puff up. Flip and brown the other side too.
                    </li>
                    <li> Place them in a roti basket or casserole and spread butter on top. Prepare all Butter Naan this way. You can stack them in the roti basket, then serve immediately or later.</li>
                    <li> Serve soft Butter Naan with dal or curry of your choice. </li>
                </ul>
