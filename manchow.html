    <h2> MANCHOW SOUP </h2>
    <hr size="4" noshade color="black">
    <p>
        This vegan soup is spicy, with a thick broth, yummy fried noodles and a bunch of different stir fried vegetables. It is simply delicious. In fact, aside from Hot and Sour Soup and Tom Yum Soup, manchow is one of our favorite dishes to order at Chinese restaurants or for takeout.
        <br>
        An assortment of vegetables are chopped finely and stir-fried, then added to a thick, savory broth flavored with soy sauce and rice vinegar and topped with crispy fried noodles. It is a delightful starter for an Indo-Chinese feast, but also makes for a lovely, light meal on its own.
