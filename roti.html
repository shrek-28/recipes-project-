                <h3> KNEAD AND ROLL ROTI DOUGH </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li> Take 3 cups of whole wheat flour (atta) in a bowl. Add about 1 teaspoon of salt or according to taste. Add a bit of water and 1 to 2 tablespoons ghee or oil and start mixing. </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li> For the oil you can use sunflower oil, avocado oil, grapeseed oil, rice bran oil and also peanut oil. </li> 
                        <li>You can measure and keep about 1 to 1.25 cups of water that you will be needing depending upon the quality of the flour. </li>
                        <li> 3 cups of flour might be difficult to handle and work upon. So you can reduce the quantity of flour if needed. </li>    
                        <li> If your whole wheat flour has a lot of bran then sieve it. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li> Adding water to the dough in parts, begin to knead the dough. </li>
                    <li> Continue to knead the dough. Keep adding water as required, knocking the dough down as you knead to create more gluten. </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li> If you add all the water at once, then the flour will become too sticky to handle. So add in parts as needed. </li>
                        <li> At the final stage of kneading the dough, some people prefer to throw the dough from a height of approximately 1 to 2 feet to the bowl while kneading. </li>
                        <li> This helps in making the dough soft. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li> Keep on kneading till the dough becomes pliable and soft. The final dough consistency should be neither sticky nor hard. </li>
                    <ul> 
                        <li> After kneading the dough, cover it with a plate or cloth and allow it to rest for 20 to 30 minutes. </li>
                        <li> While you can make the roti straight away after kneading the dough, this 30 minute waiting period helps the gluten relax, which makes it easier to roll out. </li>
                        <li> Note: You can also use a stand mixer or roti maker appliances to knead the dough if you prefer. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li> Now make small to medium balls of the dough. Roll the balls in the palms of your hands to smoothen it. Flatten the ball and place them on a rolling board or a clean kitchen countertop. </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Sprinkle some whole wheat flour on the dough ball. Alternatively, you can also dust the rolling board with flour. </li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li> Turn on the gas stove and put the tawa to make it hot. The tawa has to be sufficiently hot to make soft roti. I generally make rotis on a medium-high flame. </li>
                    <li> While tawa is getting hot, start rolling the dough ball into a flat round circle. </li>
                    <li> Keep on rolling till you get an even circle as shown in the picture below. Making the roti round is not easy! </li>
                </ul>
                <h3> HOW TO MAKE TAWA ROTI </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li> Place the rolled roti dough on a hot tawa or skillet. Keep the heat to medium-high or high. Within some seconds you will see air pockets forming on the raw chapati dough. </li>
                    <li> Roast for about 30 seconds or so and you will see the air-pockets increase on the surface. </li>
                    <li> Flip with a spatula or tongs. </li>
                    <li> Roast the second side for about a minute. </li>
                    <li> Flip again. This second side will be cooked slightly more with some visible brown spots. </li>
                    <li> Now with a clean folded cotton kitchen napkin or a spatula, begin to press the partially cooked dough on all sides and center. </li>
                    <li> Pressing and nudging the chapati gently all over its surface, helps to puff it up. </li>
                    <li> Keep on pressing all over, especially the flat portions, so that the entire roti gets puffed up well. </li>
                    <li> Below you see a nicely puffed phulka roti on a tawa. If you want you can flip again and cook the second side too for some seconds. </li>
                    <li> Place the soft and puffed roti in a roti-basket and spread or brush some oil or ghee on top. </li>
                </ul>
