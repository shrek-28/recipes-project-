        Mushrooms are an exceptionally nutrient-dense food, with one serve offering a surprising amount and array of essential nutrients. Mushrooms are naturally low in sodium, fat, cholesterol, and calories and have often been referred to as "functional foods."  The fiber, potassium and vitamin C content in mushrooms all contribute to cardiovascular health. Potassium and sodium work together in the body to help regulate blood pressure.

                <h3> MAKE MUSHROOM STUFFING </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li> Firstly, rinse 250 grams button mushrooms a few time in water. Drain all of the water and then chop them. </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Then, heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a pan. You can also use butter or any neutral tasting oil instead of olive oil. </li>
                        <li> Add ½ teaspoon chopped garlic and sauté till the raw aroma of garlic goes away. No need to brown the garlic. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li> Then, add ⅓ cup chopped spring onions with the greens. Sauté for a minute on low to medium heat. </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Out of green onions? Swap them with ⅓ cup chopped onions. If adding onions, then sauté till they soften and look translucent . </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li> Now, add the chopped mushrooms. </li>
                    <li> Stir and sauté the mushrooms on medium heat. </li>
                    <li> Initially, the mushrooms will leave a lot of water. </li>
                    <li> Continue to sauté till all the water evaporates. </li>
                    <li> Once all the water has evaporated, add ½ teaspoon dried oregano, ½ teaspoon crushed black pepper and 1 tablespoon chopped parsley or coriander leaves. </li>
                    <ul> 
                        <li> Also, add salt as per taste. You can add any dried herb or fresh herbs of your choice. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li> Mix well and switch off the heat. </li>
                </ul>
                <h3> MAKE MUSHROOM SANDWICH </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li> Take the bread slices. Slice the edges if you want. You can use whole wheat bread, multi grain bread, brown bread or white bread. Spread the mushroom filling on the bread slices.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li> You can add some grated cheese on top of the mushroom filling, if you like. Also if you prefer, you can brush the bread slices with a bit if olive oil or spread some butter. </li>
                        <li> While in the recipe I have made grilled sandwiches, you can opt to make open faced sandwiches by topping the mushroom stuffing on a toasted bread. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li> Top with another bread slice. Repeat the same with other bread slices. </li>
                    <li> Place in a preheated toaster or grill. You can also toast these sandwiches in a handheld stove top toaster or a skillet or frying pan. </li>
                    <li> Grill the sandwich till crisp and golden. </li>
                    <li> Slice and serve the Mushroom Sandwich hot with green chutney, mint chutney or tomato ketchup. </li>
