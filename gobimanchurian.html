    <h2> GOBI MANCHURIAN </h2>
    <hr size="4" noshade color="black">
    <p> The classic Gobi Manchurian is made with batter coated, fried, crispy cauliflower florets tossed in this spicy, sweet, hot and umami manchurian sauce. The addition of tomato ketchup gives the manchurian sauce sweet notes and makes it different from the chilli sauce which we make for Chilli Gobi or Chilli Paneer. 
        <br>
        There are two ways to make this recipe. The dry version can be had as a starter or appetizer snack. The gravy version can be served with steamed rice, vegetable fried rice or noodles.

                <h3> MAKING GOBI MANCHURIAN DRY </h3>
                <h4> Step 1: Blanch Cauliflower [Optional] </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li> Firstly chop or break 1 medium sized cauliflower (gobi) into medium or small florets. Then, bring salted water to a boil. </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Rinse the cauliflower florets and add them to the hot water. Cover and blanch cauliflower florets in water for 15 to 20 minutes. Drain and set aside for later. </li>
                        <li> This blanching step is optional and you can choose to skip it if there are no insects or worms in the cauliflower. </li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <h4> Step 2: Make Batter </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li> To make the batter add the following ingredients in a bowl: </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li> 1 cup of all-purpose flour </li>
                        <li> 4 tablespoons of corn starch </li>
                        <li> ¼ teaspoon of black pepper powder </li>
                        <li> ¼ to ½ teaspoon of kashmiri red chili powder </li>
                        <li> 1 teaspoon of soy sauce </li>
                        <li> salt to taste </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li> Add 1 cup of water to the bowl and whisk to make a smooth lump-free batter. </li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li> Dip cauliflower florets into the batter one at a time. </li>
                </ul>
                <h4> Step 3: Pan Fry Cauliflower Florets </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li> Fry the batter-coated cauliflower florets in hot oil. I added 6 tablespoons of oil while pan-frying. Alternatively, you can deep or shallow fry the florets to make them crispier. </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li> I fried mine in batches of three because I used a small pan but feel free to fry them all at once if you have a larger pan. Patience is key when it comes to frying the florets as it can take some time. </li>
                        <li> TIP: Make sure that there is some space between each floret when frying to ensure that they cook evenly and don’t stick together. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li> Once one side is cooked and crisp, flip over the floret and pan fry the uncooked side. Flip a few more times until the florets are evenly fried and golden in color. </li>
                    <li> Drain the excess oil from the fried cauliflower florets on paper towels. Similarly fry the remaining batter coated florets in batches. </li>
                </ul>
                <h4> Step 4: Make Dry Gobi Manchurian </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li> In the same pan, there will be some oil left. Add 3 teaspoons of finely chopped ginger, 3 teaspoons of finely chopped garlic and 1 teaspoon of finely chopped green chilies. Sauté for a few seconds. </li>
                    <li> Then add ¾ cup of chopped spring onion whites (scallion whites) and ½ cup of finely chopped capsicum (green bell pepper). Increase the heat and stir fry until the capsicum is half cooked. </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li> TIP: If you are using celery, then add at this step. You can add about ½ a tablespoon of finely chopped celery. </li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>

                        <li> Also, add 1 tablespoon of tomato sauce and ¼ to ½ teaspoons of black pepper powder. Mix and stir well. </li>
                        <li> If you prefer, at this step you can add 1 to 2 teaspoons of a spicy chilli sauce or sriracha sauce. </li>

                <h4> Blanching Cauliflower - Optional </h4>
                <ul>
                    <li> Firstly chop or break 500 grams or 1 medium sized gobi or cauliflower in medium-sized or small florets. You will need 3 cups chopped cauliflower florets. Rinse them very well. </li>
                    <li> Then in a bowl add enough hot boiling water. </li>
                    <li>
                        Add the cauliflower to the hot water so that all the cauliflower florets are immersed in the water.
                        <ul>
                            <li> Let them get blanched in the water for about 10 minutes. Later drain all the water and keep the blanched cauliflower aside. Blanching the cauliflower is an optional step. </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li> When the cauliflower is getting blanched, you can prep the remaining ingredients like chopping ginger-garlic, chopping spring onions and getting the sauces ready. </li>

                    </ul>
                    <li> Instead of whole wheat flour, you can also use all purpose flour or equal mix of both flours.</li>
                    <li> Add 3/4 cup water. If you have used all purpose flour (maida) then add about 1/2 to 2/3 cup water. Whisk to a smooth batter. </li>
                    <li> Add the gobi florets in the batter. Remember that there should be no water in the gobi florets. So drain all of the water from the florets very well before adding them in the batter. </li>

                    <li> Heat 6 tablespoon oil in a pan or wok or kadai. When the oil becomes medium hot, coat the cauliflower florets well with the batter and add them in hot oil. Fry in batches. You can even deep fry gobi. </li>
                    <li> When one side becomes light golden and lightly crisp, then turn over each cauliflower floret.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Make sure the oil is hot or else while frying the cauliflower florets may start to stick to each other to the cornflour. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li> Turn them over a couple of times and fry till they are crisp and golden </li>
                    <li> Fry the batter coated cauliflower florets in hot oil. You can choose to deep fry or shallow fry</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Remove the fried cauliflower florets with a slotted spoon and keep them on kitchen paper towel. Continue to fry the cauliflower florets in batches this way. </li>
