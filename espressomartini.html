    <p>
        Espresso Martini is here to jolt you awake with its boozy magical powers. The cocktail has been jumpstarting outings and extending nights ever since making its debut in the 1980s. 
        <br>
        The now-classic drink was invented by British bartender Dick Bradsell at Fred’s Club in London. Legend has it that a "top model" asked for a drink that would “wake me up and f**k me up” at the same time. 
        <br> 
        Bradsell complied, mixing vodka with espresso and coffee liqueur, and the Espresso Martini was born.

                <h3> METHOD </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li> Start by making the sugar syrup. Put the caster sugar in a small pan over a medium heat and pour in 50ml water. Stir, and bring to the boil. </li>
                    <li> Turn off the heat and allow the mixture to cool. Put 2 martini glasses in the fridge to chill. </li>
                    <li> Once the sugar syrup is cold, pour 1 tbsp into a cocktail shaker along with a handful of ice, the vodka, espresso and coffee liqueur. Shake until the outside of the cocktail shaker feels icy cold. </li>
                    <li> Strain into the chilled glasses. Garnish each one with coffee beans if you like. </li>
                </ul>
