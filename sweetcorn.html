                <h3> STEAMING CORN COBS </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li> 
                        Choose to cook the corn cobs by the method that suits you. You can steam or boil them in a pan, Instant Pot or a stovetop pressure cooker. I show the method of steaming corn in a pan.
                        <ul>
                            <li> Take 1.5 cups water in a pan or pot. Let the water come to a boil on medium heat. </li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li> Place a steamer pan on the pot. </li>
                    <li> Halve or quarter the corn cob and place them on the steamer pan. </li>
                    <li> Cover the pan with a lid and steam corn for 8 to 10 minutes on medium heat. </li>
                    <li> Remove steamed corn cobs with the help of pasta tongs and place them in a bowl or plate. Leave the corn cobs to cool at room temperature. </li>
                    <li> Use a knife to carefully scrape the corn kernels from the cobs. </li>
                    <li> Set aside 2 tablespoons of corn kernels that we will use later. </li>
                </ul>
                <h3> BLENDING STEAMED SWEET CORN </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li> Transfer the remaining steamed corn kernels to a blender. </li>
                    <li> Add 3 tablespoons of water or as needed. </li>
                    <li> Blend the corn kernels and water in a blender until smooth. </li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li> Heat 1.5 tablespoons of any neutral flavored oil in a pan. Add 2 tablespoons chopped spring onion whites and 1 teaspoon finely chopped celery. </li>
                    <li> Mix and sauté for two minutes on low heat or until the flavors of both the onions and celery comes through in the oil. </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li> You can use shallots, red onions or white onions in place of spring onions. For a vegetarian option, add butter instead of oil. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <li> Keep the heat to a low and add the blended corn paste to the sautéed onions and celery. </li>
                    <li> Stir and mix well. </li>
                    <li> Pour 1.5 cups of water or vegetable stock into the pan. </li>
                    <li> Mix to combine well. </li>
                    <li> Bring the soup to a boil on medium-low to medium heat. Stir occasionally. </li>
                    <li> When the soup comes to a boil, add the remaining 2 tablespoons of steamed corn kernels that we had set aside. </li>
                    <li> Add ¼ to ½ teaspoon of fresh crushed black pepper and salt according to taste. Mix well. </li>
                    <li> Simmer for 2 to 3 minutes on low heat. </li>
                </ul>
                <h3> THICKENING CORN SOUP </h3>
                <ul>
                    <li> Meanwhile in a small bowl take 2 teaspoons of cornstarch (also known as cornflour in UK and India) and 2 tablespoons of water. </li>
                    <li> Mix thoroughly to form a smooth paste without lumps. </li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li> Keeping the heat to a low, add this cornflour paste or slurry to thicken the sweet corn soup. </li>
                    <li> As soon as you add cornstarch paste, mix it quickly so that it does not start to thicken and form lumps. Mix it with the entire soup mixture. You can use a wired whisk here to mix the cornstarch paste with soup. </li>
                    <li> Simmer the soup further for 2 to 3 minutes on low to medium-low heat, to make sure that the cornflour gets cooked and the soup is thickened. </li>
                    <ul>
                        <li> Check the seasonings and adjust if necessary. Pour the corn soup into soup bowls. Serve the soup hot and garnish with chopped celery, scallion/spring onion greens or crushed black pepper. </li>
                        <li> This recipe serves 2 servings but is easily adaptable to be scaled to make a larger batch. </li>
                        <li> If there are any leftovers, refrigerate for 1 to 2 days. Reheat in a small saucepan adding some water or vegetable stock to thin the soup a bit – as it will thicken more after refrigeration. </li>
                    </ul>
